# Project-Jaffy
A restaruant manager created using TypeScript, React and Firebase

Project Jaffy was a passion project that was created in the midst of the COVID Pandemic. After realizing that resteraunts were slowly becoming more virtual and implementing
a QR code system to view things like the menu, I realized that through this technology, many more features and uses can be implemented. This motivated me to create Project Jaffy,
a resteraunt managing webapp that can be displayed trhough scanning a simple QR code. Customers now have access to features like the menu, requesting the waiter, toggling do not 
disturb and more, all through their smartphone. On the other side of the application, the restaruant is able to see a queue of orders and requests and be able to access analytics 
about their service. This creates a seamless experience between staff and customers and allows for a smooth and enjoyable time during the pandemic.
